# CS-350 Project Thermostat Description

This repo contains code from my time in the Emerging Systems Architectures & Technologies course. This course focused on the evaluation and implementation of modern system architectures, including microservices, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), and cloud computing. It emphasizes hardware/software interfacing, performance optimization, and IoT technologies. The final project for this course was to simulate a working thermostat that utilzed an TI board to create the thermostat. The requirements were to allow the board to adjust the temperature of the thermostat with the buttons connected to it and simulate the heat turning off and on using the LED light attached to the board. Additionally, we were required to make a State machine diagram to show how the thermostat works.
