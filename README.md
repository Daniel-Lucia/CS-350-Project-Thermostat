# CS-350 Project Thermostat Description

This repo contains code from my time in the Emerging Systems Architectures & Technologies course. This course focused on the evaluation and implementation of modern system architectures, including microservices, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), and cloud computing. It emphasizes hardware/software interfacing, performance optimization, and IoT technologies. The final project for this course was to simulate a working thermostat that utilzed an TI board to create the thermostat. The requirements were to allow the board to adjust the temperature of the thermostat with the buttons connected to it and simulate the heat turning off and on using the LED light attached to the board. Additionally, we were required to make a State machine diagram to show how the thermostat works. This course also helped me gain debugging and troubleshooting skills as well. For this course, we were required to order the board we used to simulate the thermostat. The first board I received was faulty, and I spent the first week I had the board with my code not working. I ended up spending hours trying to figure out what the problem was. Eventuallt after talking with my professor and looking over all the material I had, I determined my board was faulty and decided to order a new board. Once the new board arived i tested all my code, and it ended up working perfectly. It was a tough course but a great learning experience.
