# CS-350-Project-Thermostat

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The main goal of this project was to simulate a working thermostat that utilzed an TI board to create the thermostat. The requirements were to allow the board to adjust the temperate of the thermostat with the buttons connected to it and simulate the heat turning off and on using the LED light attched to the board. Additionally we were required to make a State machine diagram to show how the thermostat works. 

What did you do particularly well?

This was a tough project to complete but I think I ended up doing a good job considering this was my first time completing a project of this nature. I believe I did a good job on the code for the thermostat and the state machine diagram. The diagrm turned out really well and I enjoy making designs of this nature and the code had me struggling at times but in the end it function pretty well and I am happy with how it turned out.

Where could you improve?

I'm still not super comfortable with embeded systems like our board and can defenitly improve and get more comfortable creating code for this type of system in the future. This will just take additional time and practice with these types of systems and I am Sure I will get better and more confident. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

This is a tough question I'm not sure if I am adding any new tools to my support network than what I already use. For this course I just did a lot of trial and error to see what worked and didn't work till I could get the project working. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The main skill that is transferable to other courses/projects is becoming more comfortable coding in C. A lot of other course use this language so it will help to get as much expiriance as I can with this language. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To make sure my project was maintainable, readable, and adaptable I just tried to make sure everything in my code was as straight forward and as organized as possible to make sure it was easy to understand and follow. I think this is one of the most important thing to do to make sure an project stays maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
